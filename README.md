Rides4Kidz
=============

This is a project that three of my classmates and myself created for an Uber Hackathon during my time at Coding Dojo bootcamp. The objective of the Hackathon was to create a web application that benefits the community with the requirement of including an Uber API.

The objective of this website is to give kids the opportunity to be involved in after school programs who do not have the transportation means to do so. In order to receive funding, the schools can link to social medias or send email requests within the community to promote their schools. Once schools receive donations, that funding can then be used to request Uber rides for the kids. Our application has the ability to request up to six different destinations in one single request showcasing individual prices for each destination and the total amount for all the rides.
