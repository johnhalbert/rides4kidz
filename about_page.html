            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>Rides4Kidz is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping kids get safer rides from their school to the comfort of their homes. We provide schools an effortless way to request rides for groups of 2-6 children, making sure that each child is chaperoned by a teacher that both the parents and children trust. With Rides4Kidz, these children will now be able to get a safe ride home through the powerful support of their community.</p>

            <h1>Our mission
</h1>
            <p>"Congress said back in 1974 that school transportation should be held to the highest level of safety," noted Phyllis F. Agran, M.D., lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' policy on school transportation safety. "It is very important that parents, pediatricians, and school districts work together to ensure that all children can get to school safely." Rides4Kidz takes the burden off the parents to find the time and means to get their children home. With a safe ride available at a moment's notice, kids can focus more on their education and be able to spend more time with their parents.</p>
