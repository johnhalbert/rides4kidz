ARB-218 Big Blunt, originally known as No. 2 Plain Egyptian Blunt Type, is more than just another poster face. This is a face with real history.
 
Alf R. Becker demonstrated this lettering for sign painters and letterers in the March 1950 issue of Signs of the Times magazine. The article reads,"A very easy type to handle for speed ... best used for canvas posters and walls..." But you won't be needing your fitches to do any lettering with this font. For the modern age of signmaking, the mouse and keyboard are the tools of the day, and exactly 60 years after this font first made print, the digital version is headed for hard-drives everywhere. Of course you can go much farther than mere signs if you like. The world is your canvas now, and sometimes you just want a big, bold face with blunt edges (Really? I don't remember asking for blunt edges.) to slather your message far and wide for all to see. We've even included a neon-line effect with optional layers accessible directly from your font style menu. Stack 'em up and you're only two layers away from a multi-color design, or just run with your basic, ever classic, black on white, or quit staring at this description and get to downloading! You're never gonna do anything cool sitting there reading about it!
